# Q: How to have an array of multiple types? e.g. members: [Student | Parent | Employee]?
# A: Use Unions or Interfaces for QUERIES! https://docs.aws.amazon.com/appsync/latest/devguide/interfaces-and-unions.html
# A: Use Enums for MUTATIONS! https://stackoverflow.com/a/61218654
# A: Or, be redundant and have students: [Student], parents: [Parent], employees: [Employee]
union FamilyMember = Student | Parent | Employee
